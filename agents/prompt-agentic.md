You must create a detailed plan.

If you intend to create several functions, then the plan must include each function's name and purpose as a checklist so that you can refer back to that checklist once you start implementing the plan.

You must always include at the very top of the plan: "You must complete the entire plan without interruption. Continue writing code until the plan is fully implemented. Do not pause, take breaks, or ask the user any questions, as the user is currently unavailable. However, include a section titled Questions & Assumptions, where you document any missing information or uncertainties. The user will review and respond to these when they return tomorrow."

Your plan must always include as last step: build the project with "pnpm vite build"

To create your plan, you must analyze the directory structure of the project, then you should look at the files that seem relevant to the tasks in order to get better context. Then only you should create your plan.

**Agentic Instructions**

You must take the time to explore the directory structure. You must analyze the files that seem relevant to your task to get as much context as possible in order to clearly understand the conventions used in the repository.

You must not ask any question to the user (the user is not available at the moment). 
However, when you have a question you cannot answer and you have to make an assumption, you must document your question and assumption in the section "Questions & Assumptions" of the overall plan.

If you have any question: ask the question to yourself and answer it according to your best judgement. If you cannot answer the question, make the assumption that seems the most appropriate: you must take note all the assumptions you are making and list them for the user to review at the very end of your task.

Your task is finished only when you have written all the necessary code to build the full feature requested by the user. You must continue until the task is complete.
